# Newflasher and Xflasher For Android
Newflasher and Xflasher are cross-platform open-source tool suite used to flash firmware (aka ROMs) onto SONY Xperia mobile devices.

# How does Heimdall work?
Newflasher and Xflasher connects to a mobile device over USB and interacts with low-level software running on the device, known as Loke. Loke and Heimdall communicate via the custom Samsung-developed protocol typically referred to as the 'Odin 3 protocol'.
USB communication in Heimdall is handled by the popular open-source USB library, libusb.
